## What is a Recommender System?
A recommender system is an AI-driven tool that suggests relevant items (movies, products, music, etc.) to users based on their preferences, behavior, or content similarity. It helps users discover new items efficiently.

    ### Types of Recommender Systems:
        1. - Content-Based Filtering: Recommends items similar to those the user has liked, using features like keywords, metadata, or embeddings.
        - Example: If a user watches sci-fi movies on YouTube, the system recommends other sci-fi films based on genre and descriptions.
        2. - Collaborative Filtering: Suggests items based on user behavior and preferences, leveraging patterns from other users.
        - Example: If users with similar viewing habits like a particular movie, the system recommends it to others with similar tastes.
        3. - Hybrid Filtering: Combines content-based and collaborative filtering for more accurate recommendations.
        - Example: Netflix uses hybrid filteringâ€”recommending shows based on both content similarity and user preferences.
        Since you're working with YouTube videos, content-based filtering will rely on video metadata, tags, transcripts, and descriptions for recommendations. Let me know if you need guidance on implementation!
